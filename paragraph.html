    <h1>What is a Planet?</h1>
    <p align = "justify">
        A celestial body distinguished from the fixed stars by having an apparent motion of its own (including the moon
        and sun), especially with reference to its supposed influence on people and events.
        A planet is a large astronomical body that is neither a star nor a stellar remnant. There are competing
        scientific definitions of a "planet". In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical
        Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that
        directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects. The IAU has also declared
        that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition.[a][1][2] In the
        geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite.
        In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto
        and planetary-mass moons.[3] Bodies meeting the geological definition are sometimes called "planetary-mass
        objects" or "planemos" for short.
